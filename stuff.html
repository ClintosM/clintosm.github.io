        <p>I started this during 2021, but cancelled development due to not really knowing what to do with it. But this was REALLY fun to work on!</p>

        <p>A top-down 2D shooter prototype I created back during one of my college courses in late 2018. Created using the classic 'gamemaker: studio' engine. Ahh, good times ^.^</p>
        <p>(If you're giving it a go, the 'Rover' (power-up ability temporarily grants insanely fast shooting speed, infinite ammo & faster movement speed) and 'Endemic' (chance for shards to spawn when defeating enemies, and the power-up ability is a glorified OP shotgun) classes are the most fun to play with, they're just super broken lol!)</p>
